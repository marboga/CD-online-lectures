##AJAX

- super great!

- Asynchronous Javascript And XML

- Allows you to:
	- update web pages without reloading
 	- send requests to a server after the page has loaded
	- receive responses from a server after the page has loaded
	- send data to a server in the background


- Works with your own servers as well as external APIs

- examples: autocomplete, google maps, news feeds

##API

- Application Programming Interface

- A resource meant to be used by other developers

- allows you to use data others have collected

- There are TONS of APIs out there -- if you can think of it, there's an API for it


	Advantages
	- development speed
	- cross language / cross platform
	- increase market size
